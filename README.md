VisionPreviewer
===============

An OSX Preview-style image viewer that simulates various vision deficiencies associated with color blindness.

## Acknowledgements

The `CIFilter`'s used to simulate vision deficiences come from Craig Hockenberry's [VisionDefectSimulation](https://github.com/chockenberry/VisionDefectSimulation) project.

The app uses an `IKImageView` to preview the image and, in order to provide zooming, uses Nicholas Riley's [ScrollViewWorkaround](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2060614/ikimageview-and-scroll-bars).
