VisionPreviewer
===============

An OSX Preview-style image viewer that simulates various vision deficiencies.

## Acknowledgements

The `CIFilters` used to simulate vision deficiences come from Craig Hockenberry's [VisionDefectSimulation project](https://github.com/chockenberry/VisionDefectSimulation).

The app uses an `IKImageView` to preview the image and, in order to provide zooming, uses [Nicholas Riley's ScrollViewWorkaround](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2060614/ikimageview-and-scroll-bars).
